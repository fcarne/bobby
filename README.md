This basic Chess game is a humble tribute to famous Chess player [Robert James "Bobby" Fischer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fischer), World Chess Champion.

Note that the author does not agree with Fischer's political and religious opinions, but remains a fan of his genius at Chess.

**Note:** requires Java 11

## How to launch

### From a released JAR

1. If not already done, you can install OpenJDK 11 for free (see the excellent distributions of [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot))
2. Download the [latest release JAR](https://github.com/teemoo7/bobby/releases/download/bobby-0.1/bobby-0.1.jar)
3. Then launch the downloaded JAR
    ```
    java -jar bobby-0.1.jar 
    ```
 
### From source code

1. Checkout the code
2. Build it with maven
    ```
     mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
    ```
3. Launch the created JAR
    ```
    java -jar target/bobby-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 
    ```

### Online

Open https://www.bobby-chess.com/bobby/ for a browser version of the game (limited to one single user at a time).

## Features

### Game

* AI with multiple strength level, from random-stupid to 3-depths computation, using a minimax algorithm
* All moves implemented
* Change GUI view according to selected color
* Draw proposals
* Undo last move
* Suggest move
* Usage of 15+ famous openings
* Limit computation time to _n_ seconds
* Save game to and load from text files with basic notation
* Load PGN file
* AI is as arrogant as the real Bobby was :smile:

### Technical

* Uses Java 11
* Ability to use bundled light JRE ([doc here](PACKAGE.md))
* Strong code coverage, incl. GUI testing
* Code style with Checkstyle, code quality with SpotBugs and SonarSource
* Pipeline with TravisCI
* Uses a nice modern Look & Feel [FlatLaf](https://github.com/JFormDesigner/FlatLaf) for all platforms
* Uses free font _FreeSerif_ in order to have a nice rendering of chess pieces

## Limitations

### Computation time

The implemented AI works uses a depth-first computation, which means that if the computation time is restricted, it may not evaluate every single possible move: it evaluates as deep as possible a first move, then a second, etc, but has no guarantee to cover every move of the first depth.
